# Multi-Objective Continuous Optimisation Problems MO-ICOP

## Content

- R code for generating MO-ICOP
- JMetal code for integrating generated MO-ICOPs in JMetal. In the ICOP.java file, you will need to change the path to the ICOP parameters (line 103 and 105)


## PPSN2020/GECCO2021 problems

Problems used in the PPSN2020 and GECCO2021 can be found at

The reference Pareto fronts used for calculating Hyper volumes can be found here (quite a large
