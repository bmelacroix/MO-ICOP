# Multi-Objective Continuous Optimisation Problems MO-ICOP

## Content

- R code for generating MO-ICOP
- JMetal code for integrating generated MO-ICOPs in JMetal. In the ICOP.java file, you will need to change the path to the ICOP parameters (line 103 and 105)


## PPSN2020/GECCO2021 problems

Problems used in the PPSN2020 and GECCO2021 can be found in the 'PPSN2021 problems.zip' file

The reference Pareto fronts used for calculating Hyper volumes can be found here (quite a large
